## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously, and I appreciate your help in keeping this project safe. If you find a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Create a GitHub Issue:** Go to the "Issues" tab of this repository and create a new issue.
2.  **Title the Issue:** Please start the title with `[Security]` so I can easily see it. For example: `[Security] Issue with input handling`.
3.  **Describe the Issue:** In the issue description, please provide as much detail as possible, including:
    *   A description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce it.
    *   Any other information that could be helpful.

I am a student, so I will do my best to review and address the issue as soon as I can. Thank you for your patience and for helping to make my project better
