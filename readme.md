# 🤖 Chatbot-By-Lakshmi-Narayan-V3

Welcome to my Chatbot project! This is a simple, fun chat program written in Python. I've been learning a lot about coding, and this is my third version, packed with improvements.

## ✨ Features

*   **Smart Conversations:** Powered by the `chatterbot` library, it learns from conversations.
*   **Easy to Run:** With just a few commands, you can have it running on your own computer.
*   **Use Your Own Data** : Yes, make a small txt file, for the training, set your parameters, and tokenize it, with my very own text tokenizer... Then run the main script that is *pico_gpt_train.py*

## 🚀 How to Use: A Deep Dive Guide

Follow these steps carefully to start chatting with the bot on your computer.

### Step 1: Get the Code

First, you need to copy the project files to your computer. The best way to do this is with `git`. If you don't have git, you can also download the project as a ZIP file.

*   Open your computer's **Terminal** (on Mac/Linux) or **Git Bash / Command Prompt** (on Windows).
*   Copy and paste this command, then press Enter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Narayan-kanha/Chatbot-By-Lakshmi-Narayan-V3.git
```

This will create a new folder on your computer called `Chatbot-By-Lakshmi-Narayan-V3` with all the project code inside.

### Step 2: Go Into the Project Folder

Now, you need to tell your terminal to go inside the new folder you just created.

*   Type this command and press Enter:

```bash
cd Chatbot-By-Lakshmi-Narayan-V3
```
Your terminal is now operating inside the project folder.

### Step 3: Install the Required Libraries

This chatbot needs some special Python libraries to work. I've listed them in a file called `requirements.txt`.

*   Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
*   Run this command to install everything the chatbot needs. It might take a few minutes!
*   **Note:** You may need to check all of the files, if they run or not... if not, please tell me the issue at `lakshminarayan.mcs@gmail.com` please dont spam... I may not be using my email at that time...

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Train the Chatbot

Before you can chat, you need to train the bot so it knows how to talk.

*   Run the `train.py` script with this command:

```bash
python train.py
```
Wait for the training to finish. You'll see some output in the terminal as it learns.

### Step 5: Start Chatting!

You're all set! Now you can run the main program and start talking to your new chatbot.

*   Run this final command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The chatbot will greet you. Type your message and press Enter to have a conversation!
